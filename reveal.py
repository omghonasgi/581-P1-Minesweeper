Description: Uncovering mechanics for Minesweeper. Uncovers a selected cell, detects
    a mine and reports the loss, reports the adjacent-mine number, and recursively
    cascades through blank cells. Mines are generated on the first reveal so the
    first click is always safe.
Inputs: the Board to uncover cells on, the MineManager used to build the minefield on
    the first reveal, the user-selected mine count (10-20), and a (row, col) position
    per request, where row is 0-indexed and col is a column letter A-J.
Outputs: a RevealResult for every request, plus in-place changes to the board's cell
    states. Nothing is printed; the UI and game-logic modules decide what to display.
